        *   Language: TypeScript
        *   Runtime: Node.js
        *   Framework: Express (v4)
        *   Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose v8 ODM)
        *   Authentication: JWT (`jsonwebtoken`), Password Hashing (`bcryptjs`)
        *   File Uploads: Multer (for `multipart/form-data`)
        *   Cloud Storage: Cloudinary (for image hosting)
        *   Payment Integration: Stripe (`stripe` SDK)
        *   Validation: `express-validator`
        *   Environment Variables: `dotenv`
        *   CORS: `cors`
        *   Cookies: `cookie-parser`
    *   **API Type:** RESTful API
    *   **Authentication Method:** HTTP-only cookie (`auth_token`)

*   üöß **API Endpoints:**
    *   **Auth:**
        *   `POST /api/auth/login`: User login.
        *   `POST /api/auth/logout`: User logout.
        *   `GET /api/auth/validate-token`: Validate current session token.
    *   **Users:**
        *   `POST /api/users/register`: Register a new user.
        *   `GET /api/users/me`: Get current logged-in user's profile.
    *   **Hotels (Public Access & Booking):**
        *   `GET /api/hotels/search`: Search hotels with filters (destination, adultCount, childCount, facilities, types, stars, maxPrice, sortOption, page).
        *   `GET /api/hotels`: Get all hotels (likely for general display, supports pagination implicitly via search).
        *   `GET /api/hotels/:id`: Get details of a specific hotel by its ID.
        *   `POST /api/hotels/:hotelId/bookings/payment-intent`: Create a Stripe payment intent for booking a hotel (requires authentication).
        *   `POST /api/hotels/:hotelId/bookings`: Finalize a hotel booking after successful payment (requires authentication).
    *   **My Hotels (Hotel Owner/Admin - Requires Authentication):**
        *   `POST /api/my-hotels`: Add a new hotel (expects `multipart/form-data` including `imageFiles`).
        *   `GET /api/my-hotels`: Get all hotels owned by the logged-in user.
        *   `GET /api/my-hotels/:id`: Get details of a specific hotel owned by the user, by hotel ID.
        *   `PUT /api/my-hotels/:id`: Update an existing hotel owned by the user (expects `multipart/form-data`, can include `imageFiles` for new images and `imageUrls` for existing ones).
    *   **My Bookings (Registered User - Requires Authentication):**
        *   `GET /api/my-bookings`: Get all bookings made by the logged-in user.

*   üöß **Any specific testing requirement or known constraint:**
    *   Authentication relies on an HTTP-only cookie named `auth_token`. Test cases must handle cookie acquisition and usage.
    *   Image uploads for hotels use `multipart/form-data`. API tests for hotel creation/update need to simulate this.
    *   Stripe payment integration is a critical flow. End-to-end tests should cover the payment process, and API tests should verify payment intent creation and booking confirmation logic.
    *   The application uses `react-query` for client-side data fetching and caching, which might influence UI state and test assertions for frontend tests.
    *   Backend uses `express-validator` for input validation; API tests should include cases for valid and invalid inputs.
