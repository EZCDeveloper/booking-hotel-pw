# üß™ Guide for Adding `data-testid` in Web Applications

Review the source code of this application and add `data-testid` attributes to elements you consider appropriate to improve the **robustness and stability** of automated tests (for example, when using tools like **Cypress**, **Playwright**, or **Testing Library**).

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Assign `data-testid` **only to important elements** related to business logic or critical user flows:
  - Forms
  - Action buttons
  - Input fields
  - Validation or success messages

- **Avoid** adding them to:
  - Decorative or purely visual elements
  - Frequently changing elements (e.g., animated icons, labels generated by visual libraries)

- Use **descriptive and consistent names**:
  - Examples:
    - `data-testid="login-submit-button"`
    - `data-testid="room-price"`
    - `data-testid="form-error-message"`

- Do not replace good practices such as:
  - Selecting by **CSS**
  - Selecting by **semantic roles**

  Use `data-testid` as **additional support** for fragile or highly dynamic cases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Application
